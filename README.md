# ethereum-tools

This is a fork of [ethereum-input-data-decoder](https://github.com/miguelmota/ethereum-input-data-decoder) with few improvements.

- Ethereum Unit Converter (Wei / Gwei / Ether converter)
- Timestamp Date Converter (UNIX timestamp / Human readable converter)
- Hexadecimal Converter
- Transaction Decoder
- JSON5 Parser
- Get ABI by Contract Address feature
- Auto Decode and paste units into Unit or Timestamp Converters

Please check the original repo for documentation and an NPM package.

The motivation behind this fork is that the archived code actually works fine and it's useful when your team needs to validate the transactions before actually deploying or executing them (e.g. via multi-sig) as well as have common Ethereum tools in a single place.

The code is ugly, but it works. This tool was built with speed in mind waiting for a perfectly clean refactor using another cool JS frontend framework.

web interface is available [here](https://bonnevoyager.github.io/ethereum-tools/).
